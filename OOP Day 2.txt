Goals for today:
-review and cement the basic OOP principles
-become a little more comfortable with "big" applications
-our thought process when we need to start designing an applications


Car Dealership
-Which to design first? The public interfce or the inner details
    - "top down" or "bottom up" design concept
    - depends on a lot of factors and most teams will use both when delivering software

- Top Down: 
    -identify "top level" objects first then find objects that represent smaller portions of the system.
    -We cotinually refine those definitions until the system is complete
    -In our Dealership application this may look like this, designing objects in this order:
        -Dealership
        -Departments
        -Staff
        -Vehicles

- Bottom Up:
    -the lowest level of objects would be designed first and then those objects would be combined into bigger modules until the overall system is complete
    - In our Dealership this would be designed in this order:
        -Vehicles
        -Departments
        -Dealership
        -Staff

Starting w/ Vehicles
-Object Hierarchy
    -"Gen-Spec" (Generalized-Specialized) / "is-a" relationship
    - Find common abstractions and model those in our base class the having specialized classes
